# ✅ DevOps Basics 👨🏻‍💻

## ✅ What is DevOps? 🪢
DevOps is a culture and set of practices that aims to automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams, enabling them to build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.

## ✅ How DevOps can help? 🔪
DevOps can help organizations achieve faster time-to-market, higher quality software releases, increased collaboration between teams, and improved overall efficiency.

## ✅ Some DevOps best practices🔪
- Infrastructure as code (IaC)
- Automated testing
- Continuous monitoring
- Microservices architecture
- Agile methodologies

## ✅ Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment🔪

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: The practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository, where automated builds and tests are run.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: The practice of ensuring that code is always in a deployable state, allowing for it to be released to production at any time.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Takes CD a step further by automatically deploying every change that passes through the CI/CD pipeline to production.

## ✅ Roles in DevOps🔪

- **SCM Team**: Responsible for managing and versioning the source code using tools like Git.
- **QA Team**: Ensures the quality of software releases by designing and executing testing strategies.
- **Operations Team**: Manages and maintains the infrastructure, ensuring reliability and scalability.

## ✅ Benefits of CI/CD🔪

- Accelerated time-to-market
- Reduced deployment failures
- Improved collaboration and communication
- Faster feedback loops

## ✅ DevOps Tools 🔪

- **Major CI Tools**: Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI.
- **Major Containerization Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes.
- **Major Configuration Management Tools**: Ansible, Chef, Puppet.
- **Major Monitoring Tools**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
- **Major Test Automation Tools**: Selenium, JUnit, PyTest.

## ✅ Virtualization

- **What is Virtualization?**: Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, such as a server, storage device, network, or operating system.
- **Types of Virtualization**: Hardware/Server Virtualization, Network Virtualization, Storage Virtualization, Application Virtualization.

## ✅ Cloud

- **What is Cloud Computing?**: Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet ("the cloud").
- **Types of Cloud Computing**: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS).
- **Cloud Deployment Models**: Private Cloud, Public Cloud, Hybrid Cloud, Community Cloud.

## ✅ Continuous Verification

- **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**: A software development process in which tests are written before the code is implemented, guiding the design and ensuring test coverage.
- **BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)**: Extends TDD by focusing on the behavior of the system from the end user's perspective.

## ✅ OS

- **Linux and Shell**: Basic understanding of Linux commands and shell scripting is essential for DevOps tasks like automation and system administration.
